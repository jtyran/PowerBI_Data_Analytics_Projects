It provides an interactive platform to explore insights such as:

Player Performance: Comparison of batting averages, on-base percentages, and slugging percentages.
Team Analysis: Fielding errors, run rates, and defensive efficiency by team.
Trends Over Time: Visualization of key metrics like home runs, average scores, and player speed across multiple seasons.
Cluster Analysis: Grouping of players based on performance metrics like hitting efficiency and fielding statistics.
